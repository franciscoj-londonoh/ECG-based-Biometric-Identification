# ECG-based-Biometric-Identification

## Project Overview
This project was proposed following a consideration raised by Lugovaya [1] about the potential use of the electrocardiogram (ECG) as a biometric human identification method.
The project analyzes feature selection and parameter extraction from an ECG database, and proposed a model to identify the subjects based on these features, delivering insights on the impact of feature engineering and the potential use of ECG as a biometric human identification signal. 
The ECG database, created and contributed by Lugovaya [1] and available at [Physionet](https://physionet.org/content/ecgiddb/1.0.0/), consists of 310 ECG recordings from 90 volunteers (44 men and 46 women aged from 13 to 75 years), with a duration of 20 seconds, digitized at 500 Hz with 12-bit resolution over a nominal ±10 mV range. Additionally, complementary files contain information about age, gender and recording date (.hea file). The number of records for each person varies from 2 (collected on one day) to 20 (collected periodically over 6 months).

## Background
The ECG is a record of electrical currents generated by the beating heart and depends on the anatomic features of the human heart and body. Thus, the ECG has the potential to be a distinctive human characteristic. In machine learning, a supervised classification algorithm can be proposed to accomplish the biometric identification of a subject based on the ECG signal. But how can the ECG signal be used as input for the proposed model? Applying feature engineering, analizing the obtained results, and then comparing the selected parameters and the raw signal as input are an integrative part for the optimization of the model and the use of the ECG signal as a biometric human identification method.

## Project Highlight
The development of this project involved:
* Preparation of data, including parameter extraction, feature engineering and selection 
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on biomedical data to inform model training and explain model performance
* Propose a supervised classification model (SVM linear) for biometric human identification based on basic demographic and ECG features
* Train and test a SVM linear model selecting different features
* Assess and compare the performance of each trained model through proposed metrics

## The Project at a glance

Part 1: [Data preparation](https://github.com/franciscoj-londonoh/ECG-based-Biometric-Identification/blob/main/Part1_DataPreparation.ipynb)

In this part of the project, the ECG signals are processed, and parameters are extracted, including basic demographic data and extracted features from the raw signal. Additionally, partial raw signals are saved for later use. Selected features are organized in a DataFrame, and general information is obtained.

Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis [(EDA)](https://github.com/franciscoj-londonoh/ECG-based-Biometric-Identification/blob/main/Part2_EDA.ipynb)

This second part of the project shows the age and gender distributions of the sample population, and explores potential correlations between the selected features to identify redundancy.

Part 3: [Data Modeling](https://github.com/franciscoj-londonoh/ECG-based-Biometric-Identification/blob/main/Part3_DataModeling.ipynb) - ECG classification algorithm

Finally, the dataframe is curated as input for the proposed SVM linear model, which is trained, tested and performance metrics obtained. Then, additional features are added, and the procedure is repeated to compare the performance of the models trained with different features. The number of features is evaluated to optimize the process.
